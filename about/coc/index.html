    <h5>Enforcement Responsibilities</h5>
    <p>
      Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our
      standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair
      corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem
      inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
      reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
      contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will
      communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="coc-section">
    <h5>Scope</h5>
    <p>
      This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies
      when an individual is officially representing the community in public
      spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official
      e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as
      an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="coc-section">
    <h5>Enforcement</h5>
    <p>
      Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
      reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
      <a href="mailto: connect@telehealthcareai.org">connect@telehealthcareai.org </a>.
      All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
